# Todo
- Fix a ton of bugs and issues as well as memory leaks (since its not inherently fast as expected, its still not fully developed)
- Add more features and make it more user-friendly
- Optimize API as well and more error handling (again, its not fully developed)
- Add more documentation and examples
- Add OpenGL support for rendering (currently uses Direct2D/Win32 APIs as well as X11 for Linux)
- Figure out a way to make it work on Linux again (since well, the code has been largely changed and the code has to be partially rewritten for Linux)
- Add more controls and features
