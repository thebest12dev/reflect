# Reflect
Reflect is a project that creates a cross-platform UI framework that's fast, modern and easy to work with. It's based on .xml and shared library files, separating the declaration from the definition. as well as an IDE (Reflect IDE) written in .NET. 
Since the codebase is all written in C++, for a more user-friendly approach, we'll be using a custom IDE with support for drag-and-drop elements (like Visual Studio Designer) and also support for Lua, as an external library though this may add extra overhead to the codebase.

Currently, since its a very early project, there are still a TON of problems (like memory leaks, performance issues or UI issues) that will be addressed in the future.

## Creating a program
To create a simple GUI, you can directly modify the .xml files, but you can use the IDE for convenience.

Example:
```xml
<!-- xml file -->
<root version="1" uiVersion="1.0.0">
    <window title="Program" width="800" height="500" bgColor="systemDefault" id="mainWindow">
      <!-- Lua main file location for the implementation -->
      <library type="lua" location="main.lua"/>

      <!-- Alternatively, you can use direct .dlls (this may require some C++ programming)
      <library location="main.dll">
      -->

      <label x="330" y="60" font="Segoe UI" fontSize="16" id="label1">Hello, world!</label>
    </window>
</root>
```

For the implementation (written in Lua), insert:
```lua
-- main.lua

print("Loaded!")
local label = Reflect.getComponentById("label1")
print(label.getText())

```

or you can directly use C++ (faster, but more complicated):
```cpp
#include <ReflectAPI.h> // Reflect API
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void reflectMain(reflect::ReflectAPI* api) {
    std::cout << "Loaded!" << std::endl;
    reflect::ComponentId id = api->getComponentById("label1");
    const char* string = api->getComponentText(id);
    std::cout << string << std::endl;
};
```

## Building
To build Reflect, you need CMake, vcpkg and a C++ compiler (like MSVC, or g++). Then simply do these steps:
### If using Visual Studio IDE
1. Open the project in Visual Studio
2. Select the configuration (Debug or Release)
3. Select reflecti.exe as the target
4. Setup vcpkg (steps below)
5. Finally, build the project (as it will be automatically be built)

### If using plain CMake and VS Build Tools
1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the project directory
4. Setup vcpkg (steps below)
5. If you're using MSBuild, run
```cmd
cmake -G "Visual Studio xx xxxx" -A x64
```
If you're using Ninja, run
```cmd
cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/vcpkg/cmake -DTRIPLET=x64-windows"
```
5. Now, build the project
```cmd
cmake --build . --config Release
```

This will build the project and create the launcher (reflecti) as well as the shared libraries (Reflect.Core, etc.) that you can link with your projects.

### To setup vcpkg
1. Clone vcpkg via `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg`
2. Go to the directory where vcpkg is cloned
3. Run bootstrap-vcpkg
4. Now simply integrate it with CMake
## Security and sandboxing
For native code, there isn't any sandboxing, so beware of malicious programs. 

For Lua, it's fully sandboxed, so it won't be able to access the filesystem or any other system resources. It can only access the Reflect API and the Lua standard library.
